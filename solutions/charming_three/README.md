# Charming Three Challenge


## Problem Statement

Bob thinks three is a lucky number - the Three Musketeers, the Holy Trinity, the three witches in Macbeth - it pops up everywhere. So he always collects numbers in groups of three.

However, what's better than three numbers? Three sorted numbers! Let's help Bob out.

Write a function, sort_three, that takes in three integer pointers as arguments and sorts the values they point to in increasing order.

If you would like a challenge, try to accomplish this by using a single comparison operator, > no more than **three** times!

## Input Format

The function prototype of `sort_three` is

`void sort_three(int *x, int *y, int *z);` \
where `x`, `y` and `z` are the three integer pointers.

## Constraints
All numbers that the pointer points to are positive.

## Output Format

The function `sort_three` does not print anything. It changes what `x`, `y` and `z` point to in place.


## Sample Input 0
` 5 2 7`

## Sample Output 0
`2 5 7`

## Explanation 0

Sorts the numbers in ascending order.
