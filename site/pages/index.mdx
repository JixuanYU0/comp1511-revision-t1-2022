# Start Here 
Congratulations on making it through the COMP1511 Exam Prep n' Chill session! We hope you came away feeling more prepared. üòÅ

We've written solutions with explanations and sample code for each question. In this guide, each question is broken into three parts:

- **Problem**: The problem statement you saw on HackerRank, including sample input/outputs.
- **Approach**: A high-level overview of how we'd approach the question, with explanations and sample code.
- **Sample Code**: The full sample code for the problem, which you can compile with `gcc/dcc` and run yourself.

We've also included revision tips for the final exam from previous COMP1511 students.

From all of us, good luck for the final exam, and enjoy the guide!
