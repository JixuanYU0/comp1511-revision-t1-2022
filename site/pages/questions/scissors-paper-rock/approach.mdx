# Approach

_Written by Jeffrey Yao from CSESoc Education._

Let's break down what we need to do, then step through each task.

- Scan in player moves
- Check that the moves are valid
- If they are, check who won for each turn/round
- Print the winner

## Miscallaneous style

To improve code clarity, we define constants for commonly used character/numbers in the header, and a struct for player data.

```c
#define SCISSORS 'S'
#define PAPER 'P'
#define ROCK 'R'
#define MAX_TURNS 3
// Store moves in char array of length 6.
// Why 6: Array length includes turns (T), spaces between turns (S),
// AND the null terminator (\0).
// | T | S | T | S | T | \0 |
#define MAX_LENGTH 6

struct player
{
    int points;
    char moves[MAX_LENGTH];
};
```

We extract the steps with lengthy logic to separate functions with appropriate names. This ensures our main function's logic is clear.

- Validating moves → `check_move`
- Checking winner → `player_won`
- Printing winner → `print_winner`

## Scan in player moves

To scan in strings, we use the `fgets()` function in `<stdio.h>`. Between each `fgets`, we clear the input buffer using `fflush(stdin)` so the next `fgets` doesn't read the null terminator from the previous string.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  `fflush(stdin)` is not recommended since its behaviour is not guaranteed and
  varies between compilers. However, as it works here it's fine. See the
  relevant [Stack Overflow
  answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2979209/using-fflushstdin?rq=1).
</Callout>

```c
fgets(player1.moves, sizeof(player1.moves), stdin);
fflush(stdin);
fgets(player2.moves, sizeof(player2.moves), stdin);
```

## Check that the moves are valid

We perform the validation logic in a boolean function `check_move`, which checks that the current player's moves are valid. If not, it returns `false`. This requires the `<stdbool.c>` library.

```c
bool check_move(struct player player)
{
    // Each turn's move can only be scissors, paper or rock.
    if ((player.moves[0] == SCISSORS || player.moves[0] == PAPER
            || player.moves[0] == ROCK)
        && (player.moves[2] == SCISSORS || player.moves[2] == PAPER
            || player.moves[2] == ROCK)
        && (player.moves[4] == SCISSORS || player.moves[4] == PAPER
            || player.moves[4] == ROCK))
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    // Characters other than S, P and R have been entered. Moves invalid.
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

_Why use the array indices 0, 2 and 4?_ Recall that after reading the input in using `fgets`, the 'moves' char array looks like this:

```c
T = player's move on the turn
S = space specified in input format
\0 = null terminator indicating end of string


| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  |
--------------------------
| T | S | T | S | T | \0 |
```

The relevant array indices for turns 1, 2, 3 are `[0]`, `[2]` and `[4]`.

## If they are, check who won for each turn

We check the winner in a boolean function `player_won`. It uses the following algorithm:

- In each turn, both players can draw the following combinations: rock and scissors, scissors and paper, or paper and rock.
- Rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper, paper wins against rock.
- If the combination is rock and scissors _and_ the active player drew rock, they must have won the round. The same logic applies for the other combinations.
- Else, the other player won.

We can check for the presence of a certain combination using the fact that characters correspond to **integer** [ASCII codes](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) in C. This means that if we 'add' characters together, they sum to an integer value (i.e. R + S = 82 + 83 = 165). Hence, we check for the presence of certain combinations by their integer sum.

```c
bool player_won(
    struct player active, struct player player1, struct player player2, int i)
{
    if ((player1.moves[i] + player2.moves[i] == ROCK + SCISSORS
            && active.moves[i] == ROCK)
        || (player1.moves[i] + player2.moves[i] == SCISSORS + PAPER
            && active.moves[i] == SCISSORS)
        || (player1.moves[i] + player2.moves[i] == PAPER + ROCK
            && active.moves[i] == PAPER))
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Each player has points, starting from 0. For each round they win, their points are incremented by 1. If the round is a draw, no points are awarded for either player.

## Print the winner

If either player has more points than the other, it means they won. If their points are equal it must be a draw.

```c
void print_winner(struct player player1, struct player player2)
{
    if (player1.points > player2.points)
    {
        printf("Player 1 won!");
    }
    else if (player2.points > player1.points)
    {
        printf("Player 2 won!");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("It's a draw!");
    }
}
```
