# Pally's Palindromes

Pally's favourite word is `saippuakivikauppias` which is Finnish for a dealer in lye (caustic soda). It's the longest known palindromic word!

A palindrome is a word where the letters read backwards, give the same word. Another example is the word `racecar`.

Help Pally out by writing a program that which reads a string and tests if it is a palindrome.

**Input Format**  
The only line of input is a string in which you will check if the string is a palindrome.

**Constraints**  
Do not use `scanf` - use `fgets` to read the string.

Note, your program needs to read only one string - it doesn't have to read until end of input. There is no newline character as part of the input.

You can assume lines contain at most `4096` characters.

Checking the palindrome should be case insensitive, i.e. `a` should be treated as the same letter as `A`.

**Output Format**  
If a string is a palindrome, print `String is a palindrome`.

If a string is not a palindome, print `String is not a palindrome`.

**Examples**

**Example 0**

```
Input: saippuakivikauppias
Output: String is a palindrome
Explanation: This input is a palindrome
```

**Example 1**

```
Input: axolotl
Output: String is not a palindrome
Explanation: This input was not a palindrome because it did not read same forwards and backwards.
```
