# Approach

_Written by Terence Lau from CSESoc Education_

We recognise that it'll be useful to have a YouTuber linked list, so we first create a struct for it.

```c
struct youtuber {
    char name[BUFFER_SIZE];
    int num_videos;
    int total_likes;
    struct youtuber *next;
};
```

The program can then be broken down into these steps:

* 1. Populate the YouTuber linked list by traversing the video linked list and appending a YouTuber whenever a new one is found. See `populate_youtuber_list()`.
  * Create a helper function for creating a YouTuber node. See `create_youtuber()`.
  * Create a helper function for checking whether a YouTuber is already in the YouTuber linked list. See `already_in_list()`.
* 2. For each YouTuber, update their info by traversing the video linked list and adding appropriate values whenever a matching video is found. See `update_youtubers_with_info()`.
* 3. Now we have a linked list of YouTubers with the relevant info. Traverse it and calculate the likes-to-video ratio of each. Keep a greatest likes-to-video ratio variable to keep track of the greatest ratio and update a best YouTuber variable each time a new maximum is found. See `find_best_youtuber()`.
  *  Remember to check for ties.
* 4. Format and print the correct result.

It may be useful to create functions like `print_all_youtubers()` to see how input is being handled by your program and for debugging.
