# Best YouTuber

## Problem Statement

Your program is given a list of $N$ thought-provoking YouTube videos. Each video has a creator (with name length $S$) and a number of likes ($I$). (They donâ€™t, however, have any dislikes because YouTube removed the dislike button. ðŸ˜¢)

Your task is to print out the YouTuber from among those videos with the best likes-to-videos ratio, along with their video count and total number of likes to prove it. They are thusly crowned the best YouTuber!

A YouTuberâ€™s likes-to-videos ratio is calculated by $\frac{\text{their total likes}}{\text{their number of videos}}$.

If there is a tie, print that there's no best YouTuber.

## Input Format

Each line of input should be in the format `[video creator], [video likes]` (note the separating comma).

*Example Input*

```
Wild Candy, 84317
Logan Paul, 9185
Wild Candy, 20097
Jaden Smith, 35664
Wild Candy, 15321
Logan Paul, 75820
```

The provided starter code converts this into a linked list similar to the following.

## Constraints

For all test cases,

- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $1 \le S \le 128$
- $0 \le I \le 2,000,000$.

There is no need to mitigate floating-point errors.

## Output Format

```
[YouTuber name] is the best YouTuber.
Number of videos: [their number of videos]
Total likes: [their total likes]
```

*Example Output*

```
Logan Paul is the best YouTuber.
Number of videos: 2
Total likes: 85005
```

## Sample Input 0

```
Wild Candy, 84317
Logan Paul, 9185
Wild Candy, 20097
Jaden Smith, 35664
Wild Candy, 15321
Logan Paul, 75820
```

## Sample Output 0

```
Logan Paul is the best YouTuber.
Number of videos: 2
Total likes: 85005
```

## Explanation 0

There are three YouTubers found from among the given videos: Wild Candy, Logan Paul, and Jaden Smith. Calculating each of their likes-to-videos ratios gives $39,911.\dot{6}$, $42,502.5$, and $35,664$, respectively.

As Logan Paul has the greatest likes-to-videos ratio, he's the best YouTuber.

## Sample Input 1

```
Will Smith, 2000
Logan Paul, 2000
Will Smith, 2000
```

## Sample Output 1

```
It's a tie! There is no best YouTuber.
```
