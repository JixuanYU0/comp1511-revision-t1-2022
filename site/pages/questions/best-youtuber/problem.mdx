# Best YouTuber

## Problem Statement

Your program is given a list of $N$ thought-provoking YouTube videos. Each video has a creator (with name length $S$) and a number of likes ($I$). (They donâ€™t, however, have any dislikes because YouTube removed the dislike button. ðŸ˜¢)

Your task is to print out the YouTuber from among those videos with the best likes-to-videos ratio, along with their video count and total number of likes to prove it. They are thusly crowned the best YouTuber!

A YouTuberâ€™s likes-to-videos ratio is calculated by $\frac{\text{their total likes}}{\text{their number of videos}}$.

If there is a tie, print that there's no best YouTuber.

## Input Format

Each line of input should be in the format `[video creator], [video likes]` (note the separating comma).

## Constraints

For all test cases,

- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $1 \le S \le 128$
- $0 \le I \le 2,000,000$.

There is no need to mitigate floating-point errors.
