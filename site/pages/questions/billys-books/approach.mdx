# Approach

_Written by Alice Wan from CSESoc Competitions_

Go backwards with the days starting at N (total number of days).
Everytime the day is an odd number and divisible by 3, move the book back to the middle.
Everytime the day is an even number and divisible by 3, move the book back to the front.

This can be done using an array that stores the books. You must also ensure that everytime
a books is moved, the other books must be moved up by one position in the array
