# Billy's Books

It is Billy’s 2nd Birthday and he is given several books as a gift. He tries to read these books, but being 2 years old he can’t understand anything and so instead decides to create a bookstack.

Everyday Billy places a book on his floor, with each book being stacked on top of the previous book.

On every third day, in addition to stacking a book to the top, Billy also places another book from his bookstack to the top (after placing the new book).
If there are an odd number of books, then Billy will move the book in the middle of his bookstack to the top.

If there an even number of books, then Billy will take the book at the bottom of his bookstack, and move that to the top. He continues this for all N books.
