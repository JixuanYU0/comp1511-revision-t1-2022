# Approach

_Written by Hanyuan Li from CSESoc Competitions_

In this question, we're asked to find the number of times a variable has been
dereferenced, based on the `&`s and `*`s behind that variable. If we ever end
up dereferencing a raw value, however, the program should output `not possible`.

To solve this problem, we just need to iterate over the string, from right to left
(since `&`s and `*`s are processed from right to left). We know the length of the
string as one of our inputs, so all we have to do is set our while-loop counter to
start from the last index of the string:

```c
int length; // Argument in solve()
int index = length - 1; // Remember strings are 0-indexed, so we have to subtract
                        // 1 to get the last character in a string with length `length`

while (index > 0) {
    // Do stuff here
    index--;
}
```

We also need to know how many references there are. Whenever we `&`, we reference
our variable, and whenever we `*` we dereference it. So we can add some extra parts to
our program:

```c
int length; // Argument in solve()
int index = length - 1; // Remember strings are 0-indexed, so we have to subtract
                        // 1 to get the last character in a string with length `length`

int references = 0;

while (index > 0) {
    char current = input[index];

    // Increment/decrement our reference count accordingly
    if (current == '&') {
        references++;
    } else {
        references--;
    }

    index--;
}
```

Now we need to do one more check for when we try to dereference a raw value (i.e.
do `*` on a variable that isn't referenced). We will need to print `not possible`
when that happens, so we can have a check for that too:

```c
int length; // Argument in solve()
int index = length - 1; // Remember strings are 0-indexed, so we have to subtract
                        // 1 to get the last character in a string with length `length`

int references = 0;

while (index > 0) {
    char current = input[index];

    // Increment/decrement our reference count accordingly
    if (current == '&') {
        references++;
    } else {
        references--;
    }

    if (references < 0) {
        printf("not possible\n");
        return;
    }

    index--;
}
```

Now we have the number of references to our variable. We can simply print `pointer to`
(plus a space) that many times, followed by `c`.
