# Approach

_Written by Winnie Zhang from CSESoc_

The thinking behind how to implement this question requires great comfortability with the course content, especially the concept of the Abstract Data Type (ADT), Stacks.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    A **Stack** is an ordered collection of items, where the addition and removal or new items follow a "last in, first out" principle. See Week 9 Lecture Notes for more info.
</Callout>

For our question, we want to keep track of every **opening bracket**, so that we know if we meet a **closing bracket**, we can check if the most recently seen **opening bracket** matches that. The idea that we always want to check the most recently seen **opening bracket** (like the concept of "last in") and "remove" it from our mind once we know that the **opening bracket** has a corresponding **closing bracket** (like the concept of "first out"), we see that our goals to solve this question align with the concept of using a Stack (ADT).

Let us think about how to approach this at a higher level with just the Stack ADT. What we would need is:

1. Create an (empty) Stack. Then later we can start adding and removing things in the stack. Let us make this a helper function: `Stack stack_create()` that returns a created Stack.

2. Push or add items (in this case a `char` or `int`) into the Stack collection. We would need to specify which item we want to put in which stack. Let us make this a helper function: `void stack_push(Stack s, int item)`.

3. Pop or remove items in the Stack collection, and return the removed item (in this case a `char` or `int`). We would need to specify which Stack we want to remove the item from, so the helper function looks like `int stack_pop(Stack s)`.

4. Check the size of the Stack, does our Stack collection have items still inside and how many? We can make a helper function for this: `int stack_size(Stack s)`.

5. Free the Stack to ensure we are not leaking memory. We can do this in making a helper function: `void stack_free(Stack s)`.

Now we have every tool we need to create and use a Stack, how do we use it to solve our problem?

Firstly, we can use `getchar` to read in the input character by character, so we can loop it like:

```c
// Initialise the first character (like int i = 0)
int curr_bracket = getchar();

// Loop until End of File , which means until no more input
while (curr_bracket != EOF) {

    // main logic etc.

    // This gets the next character like an iterator (it is like i++)
    curr_bracket = getchar();
}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    Remember, `int` and `char` are quite interchangeable, because every `char` has an integer ascii value and so we can make our items `int` instead of `char` if we wanted to.
</Callout>

Now for the main logic. As we mentioned, we want to keep track of every **opening bracket**, and to do this, we can just push every opening bracket into the Stack:

```c
// Create a Stack to house everything first.
Stack bracketStack = stack_create();

int curr_bracket = getchar();


while (curr_bracket != EOF) {
    if (curr_bracket == '{' || curr_bracket == '[' || curr_bracket == '(') {

        // Since it is an opening bracket, push it into the Stack we created to
        // keep track of it.
        stack_push(bracketStack, curr_bracket);
    } 
    
    // more logic....

    curr_bracket = getchar();
}
```

Then, we said earlier that if we meet a **closing bracket**, we can check if the most recently seen **opening bracket** matches that.

- If it does, hooray! We have a matching **opening** and **closing bracket** pair. Hence, we no longer need to keep track of that **opening bracket** now because we know it is all good so it is okay that the **opening bracket** item is popped.

- If it does not, then we immediately know it is unbalanced. For example, if the input was `(({[)` we expected the **closing bracket** should have been `]` not `)`. So since the **closing bracket** does not match the most recently seen **opening bracket**, we already know it is unbalanced. We can print that it is unbalanced, use our `stack_free` function to avoid memory leaks and early return.

But there is an edge case! What if the input was `}}]]`, where we do not have a most recently seen **opening bracket**? Even though we know that this input is defintely unbalanced?

Well, this means that our Stack is currently empty, because we have not seen any **opening bracket**. If we make a separate `if` statement to check if the Stack is empty (or has a size of `0`) then we can handle the case accordingly.

We can see all of this below:

```c
// Create a Stack to house everything first.
Stack bracketStack = stack_create();

int curr_bracket = getchar();

while (curr_bracket != EOF) {
    if (curr_bracket == '{' || curr_bracket == '[' || curr_bracket == '(') {
        // Since it is an opening bracket, push it into the Stack we created to
        // keep track of it.
        stack_push(bracketStack, curr_bracket);
    } else if (curr_bracket == '}' || curr_bracket == ']' || curr_bracket == ')') {

            // Handle the edge case where we have not seen an opening bracket at all.
            if (stack_size(bracketStack) == 0) {
                printf("No, not balanced");
                stack_free(bracketStack);
                return 0;
            }

            // Otherwise, we can pop out the most recently seen opening bracket.
            popped_bracket = stack_pop(bracketStack);

            // Here, we ensure that the closing bracket (in `curr_bracket`) is
            // matching the most recently seen opening bracket (in `popped_bracket`).
            if ((curr_bracket == '}' && popped_bracket != '{') ||
                (curr_bracket == ')' && popped_bracket != '(') ||
                (curr_bracket == ']' && popped_bracket != '[')) {
                printf("No, not balanced");
                stack_free(bracketStack);
                return 0;                 
            }
        }

        // This gets the next character like an iterator (it is like i++)
        curr_bracket = getchar();
    }

```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    We use an `else if` instead of an `else` within the `while` loop because we want to only look at bracket characters and ignore any words, such as inputs like `abcd{{[[(hi)hey]]}}`.
</Callout>


Now, there is one more edge case!

Let us think about the input `{(([[]]`. We do have matching brackets, but not enough matching brackets, therefore this input is still unbalanced.

As we know in the `while` loop, every matching **opening bracket** is popped off the Stack, so the Stack used to look like `{(([[`, but after the while loop, it will look like `{((`.

So, after the while loop, we should expect that the Stack is empty, because every **opening bracket** has a matching **closing bracket**. So if the Stack is not empty, we also know that the brackets are unbalanced and can handle this case accordingly.

This is then what the main function should look like:

```c
int main() {

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */ 
    Stack bracketStack = stack_create();

    int curr_bracket = getchar();

    while (curr_bracket != EOF) {
        if (curr_bracket == '{' || curr_bracket == '[' || curr_bracket == '(') {
            
            stack_push(bracketStack, curr_bracket);

        } else if (curr_bracket == '}' || curr_bracket == ']' || curr_bracket == ')') {
            
            if (stack_size(bracketStack) == 0) {
                printf("No, not balanced");
                stack_free(bracketStack);
                return 0;
            }
            
            int popped_bracket = stack_pop(bracketStack);
            
            if ((curr_bracket == '}' && popped_bracket != '{') ||
                (curr_bracket == ')' && popped_bracket != '(') ||
                (curr_bracket == ']' && popped_bracket != '[')) {

                printf("No, not balanced");
                stack_free(bracketStack);
                return 0;                 
            }
        }
        curr_bracket = getchar();
    }

    // Check if the stack is empty or not, to handle that edge case.
    // This ensures that every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket.
    if (stack_size(bracketStack) == 0) {
        printf("Yes, balanced");
    } else {
        printf("No, not balanced");
    }

    // Free the Stack to avoid memory leaks.
    stack_free(bracketStack);

    return 0;
}
```

Awesome! The main logic is done!

Now, we notice that we actually need to implement the functions:

- `Stack stack_create()`

- `void stack_push(Stack s, int item)`

- `int stack_pop(Stack s)`

- `int stack_size(Stack s)`

- `void stack_free(Stack s)`

Luckily, these are all in the Lecture code from Week 9! Click [here](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/22T1/live/Week09/stack_list.c) for the code.

One small difference is that the lecture code uses `struct stack *` whereas I have used `Stack`. This is an easy fix, by adding the line:

```c
typedef struct stack *Stack;
```

which just means `struct stack *` is the same thing as `Stack`.

So, taking the lecture code and connecting it to our main logic, we get:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct stack *Stack;

// Define the stack structure itself, the stack structure in this case 
// may have a size and a top node (which is the head)
struct stack {
    int size;
    struct node *top;
};

// Define each element of a stack as a node
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};

Stack stack_create(void);
void stack_push(Stack s, int item);
int stack_pop(Stack s);
int stack_size(Stack s);
void stack_free(Stack s);

int main() {
    Stack bracketStack = stack_create();

    int curr_bracket = getchar();

    while (curr_bracket != EOF) {
        if (curr_bracket == '{' || curr_bracket == '[' || curr_bracket == '(') {
            
            stack_push(bracketStack, curr_bracket);

        } else if (curr_bracket == '}' || curr_bracket == ']' || curr_bracket == ')') {
            
            if (stack_size(bracketStack) == 0) {
                printf("No, not balanced");
                stack_free(bracketStack);
                return 0;
            }
            
            int popped_bracket = stack_pop(bracketStack);
            
            if ((curr_bracket == '}' && popped_bracket != '{') ||
                (curr_bracket == ')' && popped_bracket != '(') ||
                (curr_bracket == ']' && popped_bracket != '[')) {

                printf("No, not balanced");
                stack_free(bracketStack);
                return 0;                 
            }
        }
        curr_bracket = getchar();
    }

    // Check if the stack is empty or not, to handle that edge case.
    // This ensures that every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket.
    if (stack_size(bracketStack) == 0) {
        printf("Yes, balanced");
    } else {
        printf("No, not balanced");
    }

    // Free the Stack to avoid memory leaks.
    stack_free(bracketStack);

    return 0;
}


// If we are creating the stack what will we return and what will be 
// the input?
Stack stack_create(void) {
    //Allocate some memory to the stack structure
    struct stack *new_stack = malloc(sizeof(struct stack));
    
    //Check that there was enough memory to create the stack structure

// that was popped off and giving the argument of the stack from which to pop

```

A fun challenge: As you saw in the lecture notes, the Stack implementation was done using linked list. If you are keen, have a go at implementing it using an array as mentioned in the Week 9 Lecture notes :)
