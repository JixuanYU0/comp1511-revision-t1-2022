# Reading backwards

You have a friend that claims to be able to read backwards. You are skeptical, so you decide to use your COMP1511 skills to test your friend. 

Write a program that receives an input from the user, and print out the reverse of that input for your friend to read. 

**Input Format**  
The input will be a string of max length $N$.

**Constraints**  
For all test cases:
- $0 \leq N \leq 1024$

**Output Format**  
The output is a string, which is the reverse of the input. 

**Example 1**

```
Input: Monkey
Output: yeknoM
```
Explaination: The reverse of the word 'Monkey' is 'yeknoM'.

**Example 2**

```
Input: I sold 500 bananas to minions today, making over $400 :)
Output: ): 004$ revo gnikam ,yadot snoinim ot sananab 005 dlos I
```
