# Muddled Marks

You are about to released the final marks for all the students of CSE.
Every student name is linked to a mark (from 0 - 100), and these names are listed in alphabetical order.
However, as you are preparing the marks, you press a wrong buttom and the names become mudded ! (and there's not ctrl + z)  With over 10,000 students and your very tough boss expecting these marks to be released in 10 minutes, there isnâ€™t enough time for you to manually order the names.
Luckily, for you, the marks remain in the same order and it is the names you need to organise.

**Input Format**
The first line of input is the number of students. The second line of input are the ordered marks of the students. The third line of input are the muddled names of the students.

**Constraints**
Assume no two students will have the same name and that the maximum name length is 100.

**Output Format**
You must have the students name in alphabetical order with their mark next to them.

**Examples**

**Example Input 0**

```

James Amanda Lucas Daniel
```

**Example Output 0**

```
Amanda 51
Daniel 98
James 76
Lucas 87
```
