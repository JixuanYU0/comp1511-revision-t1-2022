# Approach

_Written by Alice Wan from CSESoc Competitions_

First store all the marks into an array.
Next, create a linked list that will contain the names of the students.
Create a funciton that will insert the names of the students to the list
in an ordered manner using `strcmp`.

Ensure to return in the correct format by returning a mark from the array
along with a name from the ordered linked list.
