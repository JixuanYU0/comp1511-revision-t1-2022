# Approach

_Written by Max Xue from CSESoc Education_

Loop through every combination of three coins that can be made and see if any combination of the coins results in the target price.   

```c
int sumCoins(int price, int coins_count, int* coins) {
    // Go through every possible combination of 3 coins
    // and see if any of them add up to the exact change required
    int i = 0;
    while (i < coins_count) {
        int j = i + 1;
        while (j < coins_count) {
            int k = j + 1;
            while (k < coins_count) {
                if (coins[i] + coins[j] + coins[k] == price) {
                    return 1;
                }
                k++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
