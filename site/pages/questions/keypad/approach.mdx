# Approach

_Written by Isaiah Iliffe from CSESoc Education_

A very short solution involves keeping track of $x$, the number Joseph's finger
is currently over, initially 1, and treating each character as follows:

- `L`: decrement $x$ by 1.
- `R`: increment $x$ by 1.
- `U`: decrement $x$ by 3.
- `D`: increment $x$ by 3.
- `P`: print the digit $x$.

Alternatively, a 2D array representing the keypad will do the trick.
