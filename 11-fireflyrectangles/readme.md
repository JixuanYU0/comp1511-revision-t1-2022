## Challenge Name

Firefly Rectangles

## Problem Statement

Poppy loves to look at fireflies, and loves how they make all kinds of pretty shapes in the sky. 

Poppy has taken a photo of $N$ firefliesin the sky, which can be represented as unique points in a 2D plane.

She wonders how many (not necessarily axis-aligned) rectangles can be formed from 4 unique fireflies in her photo.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer, $N$.

The next $N$ lines of input describe the location of the fireflies. The $i$th such line contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$, the coordinates of the $i$th firefly in space.

## Output Format

Output a single integer, the number of rectangles that can be formed from 4 unique fireflies in the photo.

## Constraints

1 \leq $N$ \leq 5,000
0 \leq $x_i$, $y_i$ \leq 1,000,000,000
