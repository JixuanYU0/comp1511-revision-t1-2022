## Challenge Name

Doss Product

## Problem Statement

Given two 2D vectors $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, their doss product is defined as $x_1x_2 - y_1y_2$. Compute it.

## Input Format

The first and only line of input contains the four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$ and $y_2$.

## Constraints

For all test cases:

- $-10000 \leq x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2 \leq 10000$.

## Output Format

Output a single integer, the doss product of the two vectors.

## Sample Input

**Mark this case as sample, but still give it a weight, so noobs still get points just for getting sample right.***

## Explanation

The doss product of $(-1,3 )$ and $(5, -6)$ is $-1 \times 5 - 3 \times (-6) = 13$.
